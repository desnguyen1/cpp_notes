# Linking

Focuses on where each function is within the c++ files

Will grab all the `.obj` files that were compiled and connect them

**If the ONLY the compiled button is pressed, no linking will be done**

**If building is pressed, compilation then linkage occurs**

If there is a linkage error during compilation, we will get an error code with a name `LNK` 

## Entry Point

Linking helps with discovering an entry point, i.e., a main function 

> We can also customize an entry point function so it doesnt have to be the main function
>
> In VSCode: 
>
> left click on project -> Linker -> Advanced -> Entry Point
